        container_name: <name_of_container>
        restart: always {
            The restart: always directive in Docker Compose specifies a restart policy for a container. When set to always, it means that Docker will automatically restart the container if it stops for any reason,
            such as a crash or manual stop.

            Here's what restart: always does:
            1. Automatic Restart: If the container stops for any reason, Docker automatically restarts it.
            2. High Availability: Ensures high availability of the service by automatically bringing it back online in case of failure.
            3. Fault Tolerance: Helps maintain service continuity by quickly recovering from failures without manual intervention.

            This option is commonly used for critical services or those that need to be highly available. However, it's important to note that using restart: always can mask underlying issues, so it's essential to
            monitor the container's behavior and investigate the cause of frequent restarts if they occur.

            other options are:
            restart: no
                This means Docker will not restart the container automatically if it stops.
                Useful if you want to control the container lifecycle manually.
            restart: on-failure
                Docker will restart the container only if it exits with a non-zero exit code (indicating an error). You can also specify a maximum number of restart attempts.
                Helps to avoid endless restarts in case of persistent failure.
                -
                restart: on-failure:5 - This will restart the container up to 5 times if it fails.
            restart: unless-stopped
                The container will restart unless explicitly stopped by the user. This means Docker will keep trying to restart it if it crashes, unless you manually stop the container.
                Similar to always, but with the option to manually stop it without Docker trying to restart it.

volumes:
    users-data:
    {
        the volumes section is used to define named volumes that can be referenced by services in the services section. These named volumes are created and managed by Docker itself.
        The line above `users-data` is defining a named volume. These named volumes are just placeholders, and their values are not specified in the docker-compose.yml file. Docker Compose automatically creates volumes with
        these names
